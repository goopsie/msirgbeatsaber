# msirgbeatsaber

Changes your Msi motherboard's lights with [MSIRGB](https://github.com/ixjf/MSIRGB) depending on what note you slash in Beat Saber.

# FYI
You'll have to either compile msirgbscriptservice.exe with no lua restrictions yourself, or use [my fork of MSIRGB](https://github.com/goopsie/MSIRGB)

# How to use

 1. Install Python 3.x.x
 2. Install requirements from nonexistant requirements.txt file
 3. Download MSIRGB fork
 4. Create .txt file somewhere
 5. Edit temporary directory variable in msirgbeatsaber.py & BeatSaber.lua to be pointing to the file you just created
 6. Put BeatSaber.lua in MSIRGB/Scripts/
 7. Launch MSIRGB & run BeatSaber.lua
 8. Launch Beat Saber
 9. Run msirgbeatsaber.py
 10. Get someone else to look at your fancy rgb lighting because you forgot you can't see it while playing beat saber!
