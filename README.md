# msirgbeatsaber

Changes your Msi motherboard's lights with [MSIRGB](https://github.com/ixjf/MSIRGB) depending on what note you slash in Beat Saber.

# FYI
You'll have to either compile msirgbscriptservice.exe with no lua restrictions yourself, or use [my fork of MSIRGB](https://github.com/goopsie/MSIRGB)
